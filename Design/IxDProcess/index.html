        <h1>IxD PROCESS</h1>
        <h2>Goal Alignment</h2>
        <p>
          As discussed in my last blog post, my goal is to create a balance
          between readability, creativity and aesthetic appeal to provide an
          engaging user experience. I want to prioritize legible typography,
          well-structured content and intuitive navigation. The design will
          incorporate unique and engaging elements. To bring across the
          aesthetic appeal, I will focus on cohesive colours and balanced
          layouts, allowing for users to not be overwhelmed with information and
          create a memorable experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Focusing on my goal alignment and the structure of my website, I want
          it to be presented professionally and attract the right audiences. My
          target audience for potential employers or clients. I want people in
          the animation, game design and web development industry to view my
          website as a portfolio of my work. The website will be a portfolio
          showcasing: animations, games, my process of developing a website,
          logos and information about me.
        </p>
        <h2>Content Mapping</h2>
            <img src = "Content Mapping.png" alt = "Content Mapping" width = "450" height = "300">
        <h2>User Flow</h2>
            <img src = "User Flow.jpg" alt = "User Flow" width = "450" height = "300">
        <h2>Explaing Interface Elements</h2>
        <p>
          To insure that have a well-structured, visually appealing and
          user-friendly interface that align with my goals I need to focus on
          the interfaceâ€™s elements. I will have a sticky navigation bar that
          will be on all pages of the website, this will have links to sections
          on the website. This will allow for easy accessibility of any section.
          I will have clear categories for all the different sections, allowing
          for users to navigate which ever section of the website that their
          heart desires. In certain parts of the website, like the design and
          blog section, there will be a side menu, where users can access
          different blogs or different subsections of the design process. There
          will be a footer bar, which visually communicates the user that this
          is the end of the page, but also will have easily accessible
          information about me, such as my LinkedIn profile and Itch page.
