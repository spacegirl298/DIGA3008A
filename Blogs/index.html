    <h3>Experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages</h3>
    <p>
      Setting up my new repository for GitHub was easy, as I gained that skill
      through lots of practice last year. Publishing to Pages was a new
      experience, but I didn’t find it too difficult. It is something that I
      will need to practice, so that I am not reliant on slides for this
      process.

    <h3>Reflections on readings – relating to my experiences today</h3>
    <p>
      Simon Harpers reading, ‘‘As we May Think’ at 65,’ was an eye-opening read.
      He discussed the relevance of Vannevar Bush’s ideas to this day. What
      stood out to me was Bush’s ideas on the mind’s associative nature. Bush
      believed that information should be organized to reflect human cognition.
      In today’s time there is an overwhelming amount of information out there,
      but it is organised in such a way that it is not so overwhelming, and our
      brains can recognise the links between everything. I see that today’s web
      reflects his ideas of associative linking and personalization, but it also
      focuses a lot on algorithms and profit, which steps away from Bush’s
      ideas. It was interesting how Bush did not embrace technology but focused
      more on the philosophy of humanity’s relationships with knowledge. Harpers
      reading helped me understand Bush’s ideas and how it shaped the the web.
      (Harper, 2010, pg. 1-3) Interesting things I have found about the history
      of the web I was drawn to Jay’s reading, ‘Flash And Its History On The
      Web,’ (The History of the Web, 2017) as I used to be an avid user of
      Flash. It is interesting to read about the journey of this platform and
      how it came to its end. I was a user during the end of its period, so I
      got the more polished version of Flash, but it was truly heartbreaking
      when I wasn’t allowed to use it again. Seeing the evolution of Flash,
      opens your eyes to the constant change of technology and companies. Many
      companies and users were drawn to Flash, as it had many features which had
      never been seen before. But then bigger and arguably better companies
      bought out these features, like Google buying YouTube. Flash was such a
      big hit for its 10 years, but once companies found better ways, Flash
      started hitting its decline. Its fascinating to see Jay Hoffmann’s
      timeline of ‘The History of The Web.’ (The History of the Web, 2024) This
      timeline highlights key developments in the web’s history. Mobiles
      evolution is something that stood out to me in this timeline. Phones is an
      object that we all use in our everyday lives, seeing its evolution over
      time, just shows how much can change in 10 years. The first launch of the
      iPhone was in 2007, which evolved so rapidly. Where in 2017 the web was
      accessible on mobiles. This accessibility and portability can be linked
      back to Bush’s ideas of making information accessible whenever and
      wherever.

    <h3>Goals for this course</h3>
    <p>
      My goal for this course is mostly to gain as much knowledge as I can.
      Interactive Media is something very new to me, unless we count the
      knowledge that CAT gave me in high school.

    <h2>Week 2</h2>

    <h3>Reflection on Moulthrop's reading</h3>
    <p>
      Moulthrop’s reading examines the promises and failures of hypertext as a
      revolutionary medium. I will be examining how his reflection is still
      relevant to the internet today. Hypertext described by Moulthrop is “a
      technology for creating electronic documents in which the user’s access to
      information is not constrained, by linear or hierarchical arrangements.”
      (Moulthrop, 1991, pg.692) Moulthrop’s definition of hypertext is not
      accurate to todays web as the internet is highly structured, which
      prioritizes engagement over exploration. Social media has algorithms
      emplaced, which decides which posts a user sees in their feed. It focuses
      more on what the user has liked in the past, instead of exploring new
      content. Algorithms have also been used to emplace control over users and
      what they view. During the Black Lives Matter Movement in 2020, I noticed
      at first how my feed was filled with videos of protests and people
      bringing awareness to the situation, but over time my feed started
      changing to anything but the movement. I had to go and search videos on
      the movement, because my explore page was being filtered. Moulthrop
      critiqued how hypertext has become dominated by “large corporate Web
      sites.” (Moulthrop, 1991, pg. 691) This very much applies to our day and
      age, as Google, Facebook, Tik Tok, etc. have taken over the web. Moulthrop
      recognised how hypertext could serve as liberation or control. Todays
      internet is both a place for activism and a space of surveillance
      capitalism. Users have freedom of speech when it comes to posting freely
      online, but users are also controlled by governments and corporations who
      can take down posts if it is seen as a threat to them. A great example of
      this control was when the US tried to ban Tik Tok in the US during the
      beginning of this year. The reasoning behind the ban was not linked to
      what people were posting, but banning the platform rips away peoples
      freedom of speech on a social network. Moulthrop’s concerns of hypertext
      are still relevant to this day, as the internet has become a place of
      control and influence.

    <h3>Folder Structure and URL Scheme</h3>
    <p>
      I laid out the folder structure into 5 main folders: Portfolio, homepage,
      essays, design and blogs. Within all these folders there is an index.html
      file. Within the Design folder, there is 4 more folders: IxD Process,
      Style Guide, Style Process and wireframes.<br />
      I separated the 5 main folders, so that each section can have its own
      page, and its not an overwhelming amount of information on a page. I
      subdivided the design folder, because I noticed from previous students
      websites that this section had a huge amount of information. So I decided
      to separate the sections, so viewers don’t get overwhelmed with the
      website.
    </p>
    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p>
      Starting off with the homepage, the first thing you would see is the title
      of my website, with images surrounding the title or as a background. At
      the top of the page I would like to have links to all the sections in my
      website, like the portfolio, blogs, essays, design and About me. I would
      like this to be on all the pages of the website, so viewers always have
      access to the different sections. I would like the viewer to be able to
      scroll down from the title, to the About me section. This section will
      have an image of me, and information about me like my LinkedIn profile,
      Itch page, Instagram account, etc. Viewers will be able to scroll down
      some more, where they can select the section they would like to go to. As
      you can see in the wireframe, the sections will be represented by an image
      which will correlate to the heading below it. For example the heading
      Essays, will have an image of an essay written on a piece of paper. I am
      still trying to decide if this part is redundant, because at the top of
      the page you can already access the different sections of the website.
      <br />
      For the Blog section, I want the page to have multiple rectangular blocks
      above each other. In the block will be a description of the blogs details
      and an image. Viewers will be able to click on the block and it will lead
      the viewer to a new page. This page will contain the contents of the blog.
      On the left hand side viewers will be able to see the other blogs, so they
      don’t have to go back to see them.<br />
